This Flutter application displays top news headlines from the GNews API.  It's a simple news reader with a clean interface.

To run this application, you'll need:

1. **Flutter:** Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured correctly.  Instructions can be found on the official Flutter website: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

2. **Git (Recommended):**  While not strictly required if you download the code directly, using Git for cloning is the preferred method. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. **An IDE (Recommended):**  An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with the Flutter extension significantly simplifies development and debugging.

Running the app:

1. **Clone the Repository (or Download):**
   * **Using Git:** If you have Git, clone the repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <repository_name>
     ```
     Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.
   * **Direct Download:** If you prefer, you can download the project as a zip file from GitHub, extract it, and then proceed to the next step.


2. **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory (the one containing `pubspec.yaml`), and run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
   This command downloads all the necessary packages for the app to function.


3. **Run the App:**  Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Flutter will then attempt to build and run the app on a connected device or an emulator.  If you don't have an emulator set up, Flutter will prompt you to create one.

**Important Note:** This application requires a GNews API key.
